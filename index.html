<p>der untergang</p> 
the encumberances of modern education, trying to pull some down a ladder or push some 
through a hole never ending where we need to end or start where we started to,
always in the moment of constant chaos,
never ending and all encompassing,
cycles repeated yet ever changing,
all is there, nothing is there
